# Optimal-Shape-of-Water-Tower
Water tanks can be seen all around the world, but how well they design?. In this work, we study the optimal shape of water tanks and find the fastest emptying time. First, we need to find the formula for the emptying time and then compute the emptying time for several specific tank shapes. Finally, we can conclude how an optimal tank might be designed.
